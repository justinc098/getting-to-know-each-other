        <h2 style="color: azure;"><i>Introduction</i></h2>
        <p style="color: azure">I am Justin Cordero and I am a Comp Sci Major at Lewis University. I am 22 years old and I live at home with my mom, dad, and little brother. I am also a part of the choir and theater department on campus.<p>
        
        <h2 style="color: azure"><i>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</i></h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; color: azure;">
            <li>How to create applications that I can use now and in the future</li>
            <li>How work in a team to get projects done efficiently</li>
            <li>Why certain applications are able to work on certain OSes and search engines but not others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color:azure"><i>My Favorite Activity</i></h2>
        <p style="color: azure">As I mentioned earlier, I am a part of the choir on campus at Lewis University. I enjoy singing and it has been the way I have made most of my friends in college. Everyone in the choir is a wonderful person and I feel that I belong. The director has been amazing and tries to make sure that no one feels left out and treats everyone with the utmost respect. I have included a photo of the a capella group I was in during the fall of 2021 (with their permission).</p>

        <h2 style="color: azure;"><i>Fun Fact</i></h2>
        <p style="color: azure;">I am unable to picture any images in my mind. I am unable to fully describe someone or something off memory unless I already assigned words to it in my head. Someone could tell me they have a "red ball with a yellow star on it" and I would not be able to picture it in my head.</p>
